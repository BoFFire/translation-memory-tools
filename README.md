# Introduction

This is the toolset used at Softcatal√† to build the translation memories for all the projects that we know exist in Catalan language and have their translations available openly.
This project acts as data pipeline and then project https://github.com/Softcatala/translation-memory-tools-webservice provides an API on top of the data.

You can see it on-line at <https://www.softcatala.org/recursos/memories/>

The toolset contains the following components with their own responsibility:

**Builder** (fetch and build memories)

- Download and unpack the files from source repositories
- Convert from the different translation formats (ts, strings, etc) to PO
- Create a translation memory for project in PO and TMX formats
- Produce a single translation memory file that contains all the projects

**Terminology** (terminology extraction)

- Analyzes the PO files and creates a report with the most common terminology across the projects

**Quality** (feedback on how to improve translations)

- Runs Pology and LanguageTool and generates HTML reports on translation quality

# Installation

## Setting up before execution

In order to download the translations of some of the projects you need to use the credentials for these systems, for example API keys.

*builder.py* expects the credentials to be defined in the following locations:

* At [cfg/credentials](./cfg/credentials) in the different YAML files: for Zenata (zanata.yaml), for Weblate (weblate.yaml) and for Crowdin (crowdin.yaml). The files *-sample* provide examples of how these files should be structured.
* For Transifex, the credentials should be at *~/.transifexrc* since this where Transifex cli tool expects the credentials.

All these projects require you to have the right credentials and often be "member of the Catalan project" to be able to download credentials.

If you are building a local Docker image, place your Transifex credentials file in the *cfg/credentials/transifexrc* directory, and this will be copied in the right location in the docker image. Remember that docker context cannot access your ~ directory.

## Running the builder code locally

This part focuses on helping you to run the *builder* component locally in case that you want to test quickly new projects configurations. For any other use case, we recommend using the Docker.

Debian:

```shell
sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get install python3-dev libhunspell-dev libyaml-dev gettext zip mercurial bzr ruby git curl wget g++ subversion bzip2 python2-dev -y
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/transifex/cli/master/install.sh | bash && mv ./tx /usr/bin/
sudo gem install i18n-translators-tools
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

macOS:

```shell
brew install python3 breezy hunspell libyaml gettext zip mercurial ruby git curl wget gcc subversion bzip2
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/transifex/cli/master/install.sh | bash
sudo gem install i18n-translators-tools
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

For example, to download only the Abiword project:

```shell
cd src
./builder.py -p Abiword
```

## Running the system locally using Docker

This requires that you have *docker*, *docker-compose* and *make* installed in your system.

First download the data for the projects and generate the data quality reports:

```shell
make docker-run-builder
```

Downloading all the projects can take up to a day, which is not acceptable for a development cycle. In the [docker/local.yml](./docker/local.yml) the variable *DEV_SMALL_SET* forces to only download some projects. This small subset does not require any specific credentials to be defined to download them.

The output files are copied to *web-docker* local directory to make easy to for you explore the results.
