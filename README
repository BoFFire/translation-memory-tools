--- Introduction

This is the toolset used at Softcatalà to build the translation memories for all the projects that we contribute to.

The toolset performs the following tasks:

* Download and unpack the files from source repositories
* Create a translation memory for project in PO and TMX format
* Produce a single translation memory file that contains all the projects

The web page of the project is at: http://www.softcatala.org/wiki/Memòria_traducció_de_Softcatalà

--- Dependencies

* python 2.7 or higher
* python-polib
* transifex-client
* bzr (bazaar distributed version control client)
* gettext
* translate-toolkit

--- Setting up before execution

For Transifex's project (all the project with transifex's type at projects.jon) ask for credential at their Transifex servers the first time that 
they get executed. After the first execution, they get recorded in the '.transifexrc' file.

--- Logging

After the execution a builder.log file is created with details for execution.

--- Projects included in the translation memory

The file projects.json contains the description of the projects that are included in the translation memory.

If context is not provided (msgctxt), duplicated translations are not stored. As result, the first occurrence of a string is added to the memory,
ignoring the rest. For this reason the projects with better translations are first in the json file.

The supported file types are: PO, TS and .strings files (transifex repositories only).

--- Applications

Located at 'src' subdirectory

* builder.py -> Builds the translation memory: downloads files, merge them and builds the final translation memory

* apply-tm.py -> Downloads a file and applies the translation memory and lists the files that gain more translations

--- Commands

Merging the translation memory with a new file

msgmerge -N tm.po new-pofile.po  > final-pofile.po
