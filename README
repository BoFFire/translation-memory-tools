--- Introduction

This is the toolset used at Softcatalà to build the translation memories for all the projects that we contribute to.

The toolset performs the following tasks:

* Download and unpack the files from source repositories
* Create a translation memory for project in PO and TMX format
* Produce a single translation memory file that contains all the projects

The web page of the project is at: http://www.softcatala.org/wiki/Memòria_traducció_de_Softcatalà

--- Dependencies

* python 2.7 or higher
* python-polib
* transifex-client
* bzr (bazaar distributed version control client)
* gettext
* translate-toolkit

--- Projects included in the translation memory

The file projects.json contains the description of the projects that are included in the translation memory

--- Applications

Located at 'src' subdirectory

* builder.py -> Builds the translation memory: downloads files, merge them and builds the final translation memory

* apply-tm.py -> Downloads a file and applies the translation memory and lists the files that gain more translations

--- Commands

Merging the translation memory with a new file

msgmerge -N tm.po new-pofile.po  > final-pofile.po
