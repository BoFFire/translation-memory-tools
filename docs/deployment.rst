Overview
========
A deployment consist of two artifacts:

* A set of data files generated by the execution of the tooling: translation memories, indexes for search and extracted terminology.
* The different web applications to make this data accessible to the user 

In the current configuration, it is assumed that the system building the data files and hosting the application is the same.

Getting started
===============

There are two file locations:

* The build location: where you build the data files
* The deployment location: where files are deployed (usually /var/www...)

In the build location, you need to do a git checkout of tool in a subdirectory called "tm-git". And then, you can execute the build*.sh scripts in the deployment directory of the git checkout. This takes a few hours and produces all the data files.

Finally, you need to execute the deploy script (deploy.sh) that copies the files into the deployment location.

In git's deployment subdirectory there is a file cron.sh that shows how to use the different scripts to build the data file and deploy the final application.

Dev environment 
==============

It is possible to have a stagging environment (called 'dev'). If you define the environment variable DEVENV you can have second copy of the system that lives in the 'dev' subdirectory.
